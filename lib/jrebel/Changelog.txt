2.0-M1 (3rd December 2008)
This version has too many individual changes to bring them out. Therefore we only outline the major goals. 
 * Startup time and performance overhead. 
   Performance was one of the main goals for this release and we have optimized or otherwise eliminated 
   most of the bottlenecks that made the previous versions so slow for some of the users. 
   There is some work to be done before the final release, but you should see a noticeable difference already.
 * Compatibility. 
   Compatibility was also a large concern for this release. We have devoted a lot of time to tweak 
   reflection and annotations support as well as integration with specific frameworks. 
   We also compiled an extensive test suite that should make JavaRebel work out of the box for most users.
 * Embedded plugins: Spring and Guice.
   We now support distributing the plugins along with JavaRebel instead of downloading and installing them separately.
   With this release we included Spring and Guice, so you should be able to load new components and dependencies
   without redeploying. More plugins will be included as they are stabilized or contributed.
 * Virtual classpath.
   Another concern for many of our users is configuring the existing build/deploy environment to make use 
   of JavaRebel class reloading. Not everyone can use exploded development and -Drebel.dirs have limitations
   in support of added classes and resource propagation. That's why we implemented something we call a 
   _virtual classpath_. The -Drebel.path property behaves similar to the -Drebel.dirs, except that instead of directories 
   you can add WARs directly, with EARs and more advanced options coming soon. 
   Virtual classpath will also propagate new classes and update your resources, like HTML or JSP files. 
   It does require some extra configuration so take a look at the configuration manual (Configuration.html).
   NB! Virtual classpath is only supported on Tomcat, Jetty and WebLogic containers in this release.    
 * Improved API.
   Besides the embeddable plugins we also now support third-party instrumentation. This will allow us to support
   e.g. AspectJ load-time weaving. Unfortunately the plugin itself didn't make it into this release, but since
   the required infrastructure is now in place we can release it retroactively as a plugin.

 * Improved reflection support. Now added/removed methods and fields in the reloaded classes will always be reflected correctly in the Java Reflection API. At the moment this does not include constructors.
 * Annotation reloading. Annotations on classes, methods and fields will be updated when the class is reloaded. At the moment this does not include annotations on constructors and method parameters.
 * JavaRebel SDK. For integrating custom frameworks with JavaRebel and getting the next step in turnaround time check out the SDK at our Google Code project. 

1.0.3 (20th February 2008)

 * JBoss support has been greatly improved, side-by-side SAR deployments are now supported
 * GlassFish now no longer crashes because of missing LogManager
 * AbstractMethodError could occur in some cases
 * Final fields were wrongly reported as non-final via Reflection API
 * Minor fixes

1.0.2  (24th January 2008)

 * Fixed an IllegalAccessError with package visibility classes in method return type (e.g. Wicket AbstractChoice).

1.0.1  (17th December 2007)

  * Support for GlassFish v2+.
  * Fixes to reflection support, caused NPE on JBoss and issues with Annotation inheritance.

1.0  (5th December 2007)

 * Reflection support. Methods added to classes will be properly visible via the Reflection API under Java 5+.
 * Eclipse PDE support. Plugin code can now be reloaded using JavaRebel. See this post and screencast for details. Instructions are in the installation manual.
 * IntelliJ IDEA plugin development support. Plugin code can now be reloaded using JavaRebel. Instructions are in the installation manual.
 * Java EE container support. We now support Orion and Caucho Resin under Java 5. Instructions are in the installation manual.
 * Custom classloader support. If JavaRebel doesn't officially support your container or you use a custom classloader there is a good chance it will work now. 
 * All known issues fixed.

1.0 M3 (5th November 2007)

 * No more need for "-Xbootclasspath/a:javarebel.jar" if the name of the JAR is not changed. JavaRebel will detect if the name of JAR is changed and suggest to either rename it or add to boot classpath.
 * Major improvements in performance. Startup time should in many cases improve two or more times (if slower than vanilla JVM). JavaRebel should also no longer use CPU when the application is idle.
 * Improved support for anonymous classes. Since compiler names anonymous classes consequently, adding a new one may rename all the rest and change their super classes and interfaces. Now JavaRebel handles such renaming without problems. This feature is disabled by default since some problems have been tracked to it. To enable add "-Drebel.enable_anon=true" to the command line.
 * Update notification. JavaRebel will now notify you when a newer version is available. No personal information (not even the currently installed version) is going ot ZeroTurnaround. To disable the feature add "-Drebel.disable_update=true" to the command line.
 * Support on Java 1.4 for Tomcat 4.x, Oracle 9.x, Oracle 10.x. Installation instructions have also been updated.
 * Fixed problems with reloading partially compiled classes present when doing a full rebuild.
 * Fixed an incompatibility with Scala Array construction.
 * Fixed an incompatibility with Tapestry 4.
 * Fixed obfuscated class name conflict.
 * Fixed a problem with Log4J Level constructor throwing an NPE.
 * Fixed problems with shared classloader on Tomcat.
 * Fixed problems with classloading on JBoss.
 * Fixed Class.getPackage() returning null.
 * Fixed problems with serialization when serialVersionUID was missing.
 * Fixed problems with circular class dependency 
 * Minor fixes
